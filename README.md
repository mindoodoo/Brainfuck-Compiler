# Brainfuck Interpreter

This project aims to implement a **lightweight** [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter using C.
For the time being, this implementation remains rather basic, however in the future it aims to be **fully compliant** to the brainfuck "specification" put forth [here.](https://github.com/brain-lang/brainfuck/blob/master/brainfuck.md)

## Building

Make sure you have gcc installed.

```
make re
```

## Usage

./bf <target file>
```
